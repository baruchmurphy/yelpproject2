It uses the react router dom so that it can have multiple pages within the same state.
The yelp fusion API allows for searching for locations and food genres with the parameters of 'best match', 'highest rating' and 'most reviewed.' 
This project also includes skeleton loaders in the loading states as well as comprehensive error handling should the pages not be able to load
